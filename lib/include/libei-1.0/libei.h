/**
 * @defgroup libei ðŸ¥š EI - The client API
 *
 * libei is the client-side module. This API should be used by processes
 * that need to emulate devices or capture logical events from existing devices.
 *
 * For an example client see the [`tools/` directory in the libei
 * repository](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libei/-/tree/main/tools).
 * At its core, a libei client will
 * - create a context with ei_new_sender() or ei_new_receiver()
 * - set up a backend with ei_setup_backend_fd() or ei_setup_backend_socket()
 * - register the ei_get_fd() with its own event loop
 * - call ei_dispatch() whenever the fd triggers
 * - call ei_get_event() and process incoming events
 *
 * Those events are typically a sequence of
 * - @ref EI_EVENT_CONNECT - notification that the client was connected
 * - @ref EI_EVENT_SEAT_ADDED - notification that a @ref ei_seat is
 *   available. The client should respond with ei_seat_bind_capabilities()
 * - @ref EI_EVENT_DEVICE_ADDED - notification that a @ref ei_device is
 *   available in a seat.
 * - @ref EI_EVENT_DEVICE_RESUMED - notification that the @ref ei_device is
 *   ready to emulate events. The client should respond with
 *   ei_device_start_emulating() and the required events to emulate input
 *
 * libei clients come in @ref ei_new_sender "sender" and @ref ei_new_receiver
 * "receiver" modes, depending on whether the client sends or receives events
 * from the EIS implementation. See @ref libei-sender and @ref libei-receiver
 for
 * API calls specific to either mode.
 *
 * @note A libei context is restricted to either sender or receiver mode, not
 * both. The EIS implementation however may accept both sender and receiver
 clients,
 * and will work as corresponding receiver or sender for this
 * client. It is up to the implementation to disconnect clients that it does not
 * want to allow. See eis_client_is_sender() for details.
 *
 * @defgroup libei-log The logging API
 * @ingroup libei
 *
 * The API to control logging output.
 *
 * @defgroup libei-receiver API for receiver clients
 * @ingroup libei
 *
 * The receiver client API is available only to clients created with
 * ei_new_receiver(). For those clients the EIS implemententation creates
 * devices and sends events **to** the libei client. The primary use-case
 * for this is input capturing, e.g. InputLeap.
 *
 * It is a client bug to call any of these functions for a client created
 * with ei_new_sender().
 *
 * @defgroup libei-sender API for sender clients
 * @ingroup libei
 *
 * The sender client API is available only to clients created with
 * ei_new_sender(). For those clients the EIS implemententation creates
 * devices and but it is the libei client that sends events **to** EIS
 implementation.
 * The primary use-case is input emulation from a client, akin to xdotool.
 *
 * It is a client bug to call any of these functions for a client created
 * with ei_new_receiver().

 * by the EIS implementation.
 *
 * In some use-cases though, relative data from a remote input source needs
 * to be converted by the libei client into an absolute movement on an EIS
 * region. In that case, the physical scale provides the factor to multiply
 * the relative logical input to provide the expected physical relative
 * movement.
 *
 * For example consider the following dual-monitor setup comprising a 2k and
 * a 4k monitor **of the same physical size**:
 * The physical layout of the monitors appears like this:
 * @code
 *        2k            4k
 *  +-------------++-------------+
 *  |             ||             |
 *  |  a   b      ||   c   d     |
 *  |             ||             |
 *  +-------------++-------------+
 * @endcode
 *
 * The physical distance `ab` is the same as the physical distance `cd`.
 * Where the EIS implementation supports high-dpi screens, the logical
 * distance (in pixels) are identical too.
 *
 * Where the EIS implementation does not support high-dpi screens, the
 * logical layout of these two monitors appears like this:
 *
 * @code
 *        2k            4k
 *  +-------------++--------------------------+
 *  |             ||                          |
 *  |  a   b      ||                          |
 *  |             ||                          |
 *  +-------------+|     c       d            |
 *                 |                          |
 *                 |                          |
 *                 |                          |
 *                 +--------------------------+
 * @endcode
 *
 * While the two physical distances `ab` and `cd` are still identical, the
 * logical distance `cd` (in pixels) is twice that of `ab`.
 * Where a libei client receives relative deltas from an input source and
 * converts that relative input into an absolute position on the screen, it
 * needs to take this into account.
 *
 * For example, if a remote input source moves by relative 100 logical
 * pixels, the libei client would convert this as `a + 100 = b` on the
 * region for the 2k screen and send the absolute events to logically change
 * the position from `a` to `b`. If the same remote input source moves by
 * relative 100 logical pixels, the libei client would convert this as
 * `c + 100 * scale = d` on the region for the 4k screen to logically
 * change the position from `c` to `d`. While the pixel movement differs,
 * the physical movement as seen by the user is thus identical.
 *
 * A second possible use-case for the physical scale is to match pixels from
 * one region to their respective counterpart on a different region.
 * For example, if the bottom-right corner of the 2k screen in the
 * illustration above has a coordinate of ``(x, y)``, the neighbouring pixel on
 * the **physical** 4k screen is ``(0, y * scale)``.
